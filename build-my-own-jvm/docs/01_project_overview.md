# 1. Project Overview

This project is an educational exercise to build a minimalist Java Virtual Machine (JVM) from scratch in C++. The primary goal is not to create a feature-complete, production-ready JVM, but to learn by implementing the core components that make Java's "write once, run anywhere" philosophy possible.

By building this JVM, we gain a deeper understanding of:
- How Java code is compiled into platform-independent bytecode.
- The internal architecture of a stack-based virtual machine.
- The process of interpreting bytecode instructions.
- The critical role of the `.class` file format and its metadata.
